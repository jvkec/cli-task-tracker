Let me propose an updated folder structure that aligns with our enhanced plan:

```
cli-task-tracker/
├── cmd/
│   └── cli-task-tracker/
│       └── main.go           # Application entry point
│
├── internal/

└── plan.txt
```

Let me explain the key changes and why they matter:

1. **`cmd/cli-task-tracker/`**
   - Contains the main entry point
   - Handles initialization of all components
   - Sets up signal handling for graceful shutdown

2. **`internal/app/`**
   - Core application service that coordinates all components
   - Configuration management
   - Dependency injection

3. **`internal/task/`**
   - Expanded to include concurrent processing
   - Batch operations handling
   - Priority management
   - Core task models and interfaces

4. **`internal/storage/`**
   - Added cache.go for in-memory caching
   - Cleanup operations for expired tasks
   - Thread-safe storage operations

5. **`internal/stats/`**
   - New package for concurrent statistics tracking
   - Atomic counters for thread-safe updates
   - Progress bar visualization

6. **`internal/cli/`**
   - Separated CLI concerns
   - Command and flag definitions
   - Output formatting

7. **`pkg/queue/`**
   - Added for potentially reusable components
   - Generic priority queue implementation
   - Could be extracted as a separate module later

8. **`test/`**
   - Dedicated test data directory
   - Helps organize test fixtures

This structure:
- Maintains clear separation of concerns
- Supports concurrent operations
- Makes testing easier
- Follows Go best practices
- Keeps implementation details private in `internal/`
- Allows for future expansion

Each package has a specific responsibility and can be developed/tested independently. The structure also makes it easy to add new features in the future without major reorganization.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this structure in more detail?

I'll break down the development into progressive steps, where each step is independently functional and builds upon the previous one. This way, you can practice different Go features gradually while maintaining a working application.

### Step 9: Generic Components
**Goal**: Add generic implementations
- Create generic priority queue

├── pkg/
│   └── queue/
│       └── priority_queue.go

**Goal**: Final polish
- Add cleanup routines
- Implement graceful shutdown
- Add comprehensive testing
- Documentation
```
cli-task-tracker/
├── ... (previous files)
├── test/
│   └── testdata/
└── docs/
```

Each step:
1. Is independently functional
2. Builds on previous steps
3. Introduces new Go concepts
4. Can be tested independently
5. Delivers value on its own

Key Go features practiced in each step:
- Step 1: Basic types, packages, interfaces
- Step 2: JSON marshaling, error handling
- Step 3: Structs, methods, interfaces
- Step 4: Goroutines, channels, context
- Step 5: Mutex, pointers, concurrency
- Step 6: Atomic operations, select
- Step 7: Type assertions, interfaces
- Step 8: WaitGroups, error groups
- Step 9: Generics, type constraints
- Step 10: Testing, documentation

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular step or start with implementing Step 1?
